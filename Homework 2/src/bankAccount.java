////Write a class called BankAccount that has the following:
////(a) A private double field called amount that stores the amount of money in the account.
////(b) A private double field called interestRate that stores the accountâ€™s interest rate.
////(c) A private string field called name that stores the name of the account holder.
////(d) A constructor that just sets the values of the three fields above.
////(e) Getters and setters for each of the three fields.
////(f) A method called applyInterest that takes no arguments and applies the interest to the account.
////For instance, if the account has $1000 in it and the interest rate is 3%, then the amount variable
////should be changed to $1030 ($1000 + 3% interest)
